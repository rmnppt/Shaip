# Shaip
A childrens shape recognition game for iOS
Three shapes of different colours appear along with some text indicating one of them.

# The Game
- If the player chooses the correct shape they score points and a new set of shapes appears.
- If the player chooses an incorrect shape then the shape disappears and they lose a life.
- If the timer elapses the game is over.
- The high score is updated if necessary.

# Unlock Shapes
- If the player scores sufficient points they unlock new shapes.
- Unlocked shapes will now appear in the randomly chosen set.
- Unlocked shapes are proudly displayed in the homescreen for the duration of the session.

# Level up
- If the player scores sufficient points, they will level up.
- Each subsequent level increases the points scored per correct answer.

# Coming soon
- Confusing the player with mismatching colour-word combinations (at high level)
- Sounds

# Features I'm working on
- The shapes are currently held as assets, I am working on drawing them programatically.
- Once all the mechanics are in place, I would like to beef up the animations, watch this space...
